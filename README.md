# HelperCollection

Welcome to HelperCollection, a comprehensive Java library designed to accelerate and secure your work with various data structures and algorithms. This repository is a treasure trove of utility methods, generic data types, and sorting algorithms aimed at enhancing productivity and efficiency in Java development.

## Features

- **Utility Methods**: A rich collection of methods to facilitate working with integer arrays and other common tasks, ensuring faster and more secure operations.

- **Generic Data Types**: The library hosts a variety of generic data types, including but not limited to:
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Heaps
  - Other common data structures

  These are implemented generically, allowing for flexibility and reuse across different data types.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: A suite of sorting algorithms that are compatible with all iterable collections. These algorithms are also implemented generically, making them versatile for various data types.

## Example Usage

To see our sorting algorithms in action, check out the example usage cases located at `/src/SortingAlgorithms/SortingExample.java`. This will give you a clear idea of how to implement and utilize the sorting algorithms in your own projects.
